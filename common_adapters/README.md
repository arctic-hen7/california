# Common Forn Adapters

This directory contains a number of common example adapters that have been contributed by the community to help first-time Forn users get on their feet with creating a set for the first time. The reason Forn does not by default provide any inbuilt adapters, as it does with learning methods, is because it's much more common for people to work with their own custom note formats. For example, a common use-case is to have a series of question/answer formatted notes exported in Markdown from some other app, and the format each person uses will be slightly different, hence why we don't prescribe anything.

You can easily create your own adapter scripts in [Rhai], a simple scripting language, by modifying the scripts in here, or by writing your own from scratch. If you need any help, don't hesitate to create a [new discussion]!
